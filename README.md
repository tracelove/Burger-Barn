Where It All Began/Overview
***************************

  Our design journey started with our teacher assigning the entire Web Design Foundations (Honors) class with obtaining some very thorough HTML and CSS badges from TeamTreehouse. Fast forward to the past few weeks, and we've completed the task of trying to make business websites on our own. 

  After that difficult, independent task, we joined together with someone else in the class that had his or her own website, chose the better of the two sites, and used the better site to become the best business site possible - as a team. Trace Love and Brennon Murray are our names. We chose Trace's "Burger Barn" website to be the better of our two sites for various reasons; hence, his website (turned into our website) is the website we are submitting for the Dev Catalyst competition.
  
  In order to get his website rolling, Trace went down to the local Burger Barn here in Jackson, Tennessee, and talked to some of the wonderful owners and passionate workers at the fine eating establishment. He really enjoyed Wanda Fly, the owner, as they had repeated discussions about what the site would consist of as well as what she wanted to see in the site.
  
  We turned that vision of hers into a reality, with such a website that Wanda herself deems it worthy of publication for all to see and indulge in. We put our own spin on it too, of course. Choosing the red, white, and occasional navy and light purple usage contrasted really well while simultaneously reflecting the outside of the restaurant. The font met very nicely with this also as it both was easy to read and fairly universal. As far as the wireframes for this site were concerned, Trace had some extravagant blueprints to work with and thus expanded on some great artistic ideas.
  
  After we joined together, we decided to work through the website going one page deep at a time. We first tried to accomplish this on separate computers and would then come together to compare changes, but we found out just how much better we worked together on the same device. This site, unlike outdated sites, has some supremely unique layers of responsiveness to it. It works decently across multiple digital platforms as experimented with by us. Trace chose the logo/favicon before the collaboration and after the collaboration the favicon/logo still looked quite neat and is still in use on the site.
  
  We had a challenging, thrilling time with this project and will hopefully be able to use these new technical, mechanical design skills that we have learned together to aide us in our separate careers in the future.

Page-By-Page Breakdown
**********************

~~~The "Home" Page~~~
-We made sure that the homepage of the website was crafted so that the website and business could be well-introduced and overviewed.
-We created the page from scratch and included the key elements that customers need to access constantly and put that information neatly and vividly.
-Note that the hours are bolded, the page is responsive, and that we have links included to our phone number as well as other pages in our website where you can find any additional stuff you may need with ease.


~~~The "Menu" Page~~~
-We felt that the menu page should have some pictures of menu items that Burger Barn really sells. No unauthentic cuisine here!
-We listed the menu in five different sections: Sandwiches, Drinks, Trays, Desserts, and Sides.
-We also included the sizing and pricing of the various options for more customer convenience and approval.


~~~The "Contact" Page~~~
-Within the contact page, we have a paragraph that tells about the page and the business's vision concerning customer feedback.
-Elsewhere on the page, we have an embedded map which aides in finding the Barn with ease.
-We also have a working PHP form where you can send emails to the people at Burger Barn while also using a neat little table which helps highlight things which any consumer would like to know if they should ever need to contact Burger Barn.


~~~The "About" Page~~~
-This page was designed especially with Wanda in mind.
-This page is primarily used to tell of how Burger Barn came to be as well as how it developed over the years since it started.
-Additionally, the page has personalized sections, telling thoroughly about the owner and the workers, too.


~~~The "Testimonials" Page~~~
-What good food website is complete without a place where people from all over the Internet comment on the fine dining or horrible time they endured at the establishment?
-We used accredited review/critique sites such as Yelp! and TripAdvisor to add to the consumer's viewpoint about the business at-hand.
-We used contrasting colors on this page to definitively convey the positive customer feedback received on the World Wide Wed about Burger Barn.


~~~The "Pictures" Page~~~
-Pictures of a restaurant's food on a restaurant's website is most certainly necessary if you want to grow your business and provide a true insight to what the food place offers.
-We used borders on the pictures as well as captions to emphasize just how delicious this food is, whether it be represented digitally, or in real life.
-When we say how good the food is, we mean it. We went and tried some of these options featured here and man were they ever outstanding for a humble Jackson burger joint!
